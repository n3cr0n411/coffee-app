      <h2>Pick Your Roast</h2>
      <p>
        Coffee roasting transforms green coffee beans into the aromatic and flavorful beans 
        we use to brew coffee. The roast level significantly influences the flavor and body of your coffee. 
        Here are the three main types:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Light Roast:</strong> Known for its mild flavor and higher acidity. Retains more of the bean's original characteristics.</li>
        <li><strong>Medium Roast:</strong> Balanced flavor, acidity, and body. Often referred to as the "traditional roast."</li>
        <li><strong>Dark Roast:</strong> Bold and robust with a smoky or charred flavor. Lower acidity but more intense.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pick Your Brew</h2>
